  <h1>Registration Form</h1>
  <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>

  <!-- As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, 
      insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org. -->

  <!-- <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" method="post"></form> -->

  <!-- The 'method' attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. 
    The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or 
    via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
    Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request. -->

  <!-- <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" method="post"></form> -->

  <!-- As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the <form> element. -->
  <!-- <fieldset></fieldset> empty block or table  -->
  <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" method="post">

    <!-- Add the following text to the label elements:

      Enter Your First Name:
      Enter Your Last Name:
      Enter Your Email:
      Create a New Password: -->

    <!-- Nest an input element within each label. 
      Be sure to add each input after the label text, and include a space after the colon. -->

    <!-- <input></input> input element gives epmty box-->

    <!-- Following accessibility best practices, 
      link the '<input> elements' and the <label> elements' together using the 'for' attribute.
      Use first-name, last-name, email, and new-password as values for the respective 'id' attributes. -->

    <!-- Specifying the 'type' attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data 
        it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.

      Give the first two <input> elements a type attribute of text, the third a type attribute of email, 
      and the fourth a type attribute of password.

      The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. 
      The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS. -->

    <!-- The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.
      To handle the form submission, after the last <fieldset> element add an input element with 
      the 'type' attribute set to submit and the 'value' attribute set to Submit. -->

    <!-- At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.
      To make the form more interactive, add the 'required' attribute to the <input> elements in the first fieldset.
      Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message. -->

    <!-- Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, 
      type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.

      Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a 'minlength' attribute with a value of 8. 
      Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted. -->

    <!-- With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that 
      the password must match to be considered valid.

      Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
      
      The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. 
      Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out. -->
    
    <!-- minlength="8" is removed-->
    
    <!-- _*The type of account*_ -->

    <!-- Let us go to the next part of the registration form. This section will ask for the type of account 
      the user is opening, and will confirm the user has read the terms and conditions.
      Start by adding three label elements to the second fieldset. -->


    <fieldset>
      <label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name" type="text" required></input> </label>
      <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name" type="text" required></input></label>
      <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email" type="email" required></input></label>
      <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" type="password" required
          pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}"></input></label>
