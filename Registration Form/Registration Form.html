  <h1>Registration Form</h1>
  <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>

  <!-- As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, 
      insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org. -->

  <!-- <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" method="post"></form> -->

  <!-- The 'method' attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. 
    The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or 
    via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
    Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request. -->

  <!-- <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" method="post"></form> -->

  <!-- As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the <form> element. -->
  <!-- <fieldset></fieldset> empty block or table  -->
  <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" method="post">

    <!-- Add the following text to the label elements:

      Enter Your First Name:
      Enter Your Last Name:
      Enter Your Email:
      Create a New Password: -->

    <!-- Nest an input element within each label. 
      Be sure to add each input after the label text, and include a space after the colon. -->

    <!-- <input></input> input element gives epmty box-->

    <!-- Following accessibility best practices, 
      link the '<input> elements' and the <label> elements' together using the 'for' attribute.
      Use first-name, last-name, email, and new-password as values for the respective 'id' attributes. -->

    <!-- Specifying the 'type' attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data 
        it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.

      Give the first two <input> elements a type attribute of text, the third a type attribute of email, 
      and the fourth a type attribute of password.

      The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. 
      The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS. -->

    <!-- The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.
      To handle the form submission, after the last <fieldset> element add an input element with 
      the 'type' attribute set to submit and the 'value' attribute set to Submit. -->

    <!-- At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.
      To make the form more interactive, add the 'required' attribute to the <input> elements in the first fieldset.
      Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message. -->

    <!-- Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, 
      type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.

      Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a 'minlength' attribute with a value of 8. 
      Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted. -->

    <!-- With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that 
      the password must match to be considered valid.

      Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
      
      The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. 
      Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out. -->

    <!-- minlength="8" is removed-->

    <!-- _*The type of account*_ -->

    <!-- Let us go to the next part of the registration form. This section will ask for the type of account 
      the user is opening, and will confirm the user has read the terms and conditions.
      Start by adding three label elements to the second fieldset. -->


    <fieldset>
      <label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name" type="text" required name="first-name"></input> </label>
      <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name" type="text" required name="last-name"></input></label>
      <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email" type="email" required name="email"></input></label>
      <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" type="password" required
          pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" name="new-password"></input></label>
    </fieldset>

    <!-- Users will be allowed to choose either a Personal Account or Business Account.
    To do this, within each of the first two label elements, add one input element with type="radio". -->

    <!-- For the terms and conditions, add an input with a type of 'checkbox' to the third <label> element. 
    Make this <input> element 'required' because users should not sign up without reading the terms and conditions. -->

    <!-- Within each corresponding label element, and immediately after the input element, add a space and add the following text:

    Personal Account
    Business Account
    I accept the terms and conditions -->

    <!-- You only want 'one radio input' to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.
    'To relate the radio inputs', give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, 
    it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time. -->

    <!-- Follow accessibility best practices by "linking the input elements and the label elements" in the second fieldset.
    Use personal-account, business-account, and terms-and-conditions as values 'for the respective id' attributes. -->

    <!-- To finish this fieldset off, link the text terms and conditions in the third label to the following location:
    https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/ -->


    <fieldset>
            <label for="personal-account"><input type="radio" name="account-type" id="personal-account" class="inline"></input> Personal
        Account</label>
      <label for="business-account"><input type="radio" name="account-type" id="business-account" class="inline"></input> Business
        Account</label>
      <label for="terms-and-conditions"><input type="checkbox" required id="terms-and-conditions" name="terms-and-conditions" class="inline"> I accept the <a
          href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">terms and conditions</a></input></label>
    </fieldset>

    <!-- Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?
    Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text 'Upload a profile picture:', 
    and nest an input accepting a file upload. -->

    <!-- Add another label after the first, with the text 'Input your age (years):' . Then, nest an input with the type of number.
    Next, add a min attribute to the input with a value of 13 because users under the age of 13 should not register. 
    Also, users probably will not be over the age of 120; add a max attribute with a value of 120.
    Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range, a warning will appear, and the form will not submit. 
    Give it a try. -->

    <!-- For the second fieldset, you want the input and label text to appear on the same line.
      Start, by giving the <input> elements in the second fieldset a class of inline. -->


    <fieldset>
      <label for="profile-picture" class="inline">Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" id="profile-picture" name="profile-picture" class="inline"></input></label>
      <label for="age" class="inline">Input your age (years): <input type="number" min="13" max="120" id="age" name="age" class="inline"></input></label>

      <!-- Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The <select> element is a container' 
    for a group of option elements,and the <option> element acts as a 'label' for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.
    Start by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then nest 5 option elements within the select element. -->

      <!-- Nest the select element (with its option elements) within a label element with the text 'How did you hear about us?''. 
    The text should come before the select element. -->

      <!-- The dropdown options are currently empty. To give them content, add the following text to each subsequent option element:

    (select one)
    freeCodeCamp News
    freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel
    freeCodeCamp Forum
    Other -->

      <!-- Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server. As such, 
    each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.
    Give the first option a value of "", and the subsequent option elements value attributes from 1 to 4. -->

      <!-- The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive 
      multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and columns.
    Users will be able to register with a bio. Add a label with the text Provide a bio: at the end of the fieldset. 
    Add a textarea element inside the label element. Note that the textarea requires a closing tag. -->

      <!-- Link the applicable form elements and their label elements together.
    Use profile-picture, age, referrer, and bio as values for the respective id attributes. -->



      <label for="referrer" class="inline">How did you hear about us?
        <select id="referrer" name="referrer" class="inline">
          <option value="">(select one)</option>
          <option value="1">freeCodeCamp News</option>
          <option value="2">freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
          <option value="3">freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
          <option value="4">Other</option>
        </select>
      </label>

      <!-- The textarea appears too small. To give it an initial size, you can add the rows and cols attributes.
       Add an initial size of 3 rows and 30 columns. -->

       <!-- To give Campers an idea of what to put in their bio, the placeholder attribute is used. The placeholder accepts a text value, 
       which is displayed until the user starts typing.
       Give the textarea a placeholder of I like coding on the beach.... -->

       <!-- With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute. 
        This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission.
       Give each submittable element a unique 'name' attribute of your choosing, except for the two radio inputs. -->

      <label for="bio">Provide a bio:
        <textarea id="bio" rows="3" cols="30" placeholder="I like coding on the beach...." name="bio"></textarea>
      </label>

    </fieldset>

    <input type="submit" value="Submit"></input>
